# IndecisionApp

This App where made through learning React.JS Basics and Environnement setups

# How to navigate ?
  - In public folder you'll find the bundle and the index.html, with a script file incorporated in it
  - In src file will be the components folder, where react components are created
  - The app.js where the final render sits and the file going to a build by webpack
  -Styles folder where is set the SASS/SCSS, with base folder in them, component folder and origin style.scss designated for build and where is imported all scss files
  - Webpack.config.js file where sits the instruction to bundle, the rules, loaders and modules
  - Package.json file where sits the dependencies, the props related to the app and third party libraries

# What Have I learn ?

- I learn how to use Webpack and to to be able to bundle dependencies
- I had a deeper understanding of package.json file, how to manipulate it so that it will suite me
- JSX syntax, The DOM (Which I already had fundamentals)

# What to take out of this ?

I am now more confident about managing files, which at first I found too big for my understanding
I can now confidently set up a react App
