# IndecisionApp

This App where made through learning React.JS Basics and Environnement setups

# What Have I learn ?

I learn how to use Webpack and to to be able to bundle dependencies
I had a deeper understanding of package.json file, how to manipulate it so that it will suite me
JSX syntax, The DOM (Which I already had fundamentals)

# What to take out of this ?

I am now more confident about managing files, which at first I found too big for my understanding
I can now confidently set up a react App
